Minutos is a cloned version of BlinkIt (formerly Grofers) which is an online supermarket application to buy Fruits, Veggies, Snacks, Milk & more and get delivery safely & hygienically to your home.



### Features

### Tools and Technologies
The application is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with sole purpose of practising the basics and implementation of [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), while building something beautiful to showcase. 

This has the homepage and the product details page recreated using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
